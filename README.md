# Palmoria Group HR Analytics

## Introduction
The Palmoria Group is a prominent manufacturing company based in Nigeria, known for its commitment to quality and innovation. With operations spanning across three regions, the company has been striving to foster an inclusive and equitable work environment.

Recognizing the importance of addressing gender-related issues within their organization, the Palmoria Group reached out to us, a team of data analytics experts from the tech academy of FirstBank Nigeria, to conduct a comprehensive analysis of their HR data as part of a hackathon initiative. The company aims to identify and mitigate gender disparities, promote fairness in compensation, and enhance overall employee satisfaction.

## Project Scope
The project aims to answer the following key questions:
- What is the gender distribution within the organization, broken down by regions and departments?
- Are there any gender-based disparities in performance ratings?
- Is there evidence of a gender pay gap within the company? If so, which departments and regions are most affected?
- Does Palmoria meet the minimum salary requirement of $90,000? What is the salary distribution across different salary bands?
- How much bonus should be allocated to employees based on performance ratings? What is the total bonus payout per region and company-wide?
